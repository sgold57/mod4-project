# Background/Objective
For my Mod4 project, I made a simple React weather App. A user inputs their zip code, and they receive back the current weather, as well as a three day forecast. At this point, I have icons, description of weather, temperature, and the name of the desired township. There's a lot more room for messing around with the specifics, so no telling if this project has reached its final form.

# Challenges Faced
Learning React has been fun and challenging. I had a realization later on the process that the way that I was structuring my files/components were not efficient at all, so that kind of led me to move back two steps to move forward. However, with this process, my knowledge about React has been enhanced. One unfortunate thing about this project is that I really did not utilize my backend at all. If I were to continue on with the project, I'd definitely add a User resource to create a database of Users so that zip codes could be saved. Additionally, my styling chops are suboptimal, so that took me quite a while. This process was a lot more enjoyable than I thought, and I'm happy with the way that it looks in the end (although there is obviously room for improvement).
